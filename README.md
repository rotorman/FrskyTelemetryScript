# Yaapu Frsky Telemetry Script

This is the home of the Yaapu Telemetry Script project, a [LUA](https://www.lua.org/about.html) telemetry script for the Frsky Horus and Taranis radios using the ArduPilot frsky passthru telemetry protocol.

**Note:**
- **OpenTX 2.3.5 on X9D/X9D+ has a bug in handling the exit key press events: it will always quit the telemetry script!**
- **the latest release versions are downloadable from the [clone/download](https://github.com/yaapu/FrskyTelemetryScript/archive/master.zip) button**
- **the latest pre-release versions are downloadable from the [releases](https://github.com/yaapu/FrskyTelemetryScript/releases) section**

![X7](https://github.com/yaapu/FrskyTelemetryScript/raw/master/TARANIS/IMAGES/x7.png)

The supported radios are:
- Taranis X9D(+) and QX7 on OpenTX 2.2.2 or greater
- X-Lite on OpenTX 2.2.2 or greater (by using the QX7 version)
- Horus X10 and X12, Jumper T16 and Radiomaster TX16S on OpenTX 2.3.x

Here you'll find
- a **Telemetry** script for the Taranis radios: X9D,QX7 and X-Lite ([changelog](https://github.com/yaapu/FrskyTelemetryScript/raw/master/taranis-changelog.txt))
- a **Widget** for the Frsky Horus radios: X10/S and X12 and for Jumper T16 ([changelog](https://github.com/yaapu/FrskyTelemetryScript/raw/master/horus-changelog.txt))


both support all of the telemetry DIY 0x5000 packets sent by ardupilotâ€™s [frsky passthrough protocol library](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot/tree/master/libraries/AP_Frsky_Telem)

The script is also compatible with the excellent [MavlinkToPassthru](https://github.com/zs6buj/MavlinkToPassthru) converter firmware by Eric Stockenstrom

Requires [OpenTX 2.2.x](http://www.open-tx.org/) and a recent release of [ArduPilot](http://ardupilot.org/ardupilot/index.html).

![X7m2f](https://github.com/yaapu/FrskyTelemetryScript/blob/master/TARANIS/IMAGES/x7_m2f_displayinfo.png)

Version 1.8.0 and above natively support Eric Stockenstrom's [MavlinkToPassthru](https://github.com/zs6buj/MavlinkToPassthru) converter firmware **Plus** version.

By using Eric's Plus version the script can display
- waypoint number, bearing and distance
- airspeed info
- throttle %

To enable this feature please select it from the script config menu by choosing "m2f" as left panel option.

If you wish to use the RSSI source provided by MavlinkToPassthru, ensure that you have the correct sensor selected in the "RSSI Source" option in the OpenTX Telemetry tab. 

## Voltage Sources

Battery voltage is tracked independentely for 2 battery sources: FLVSS and flight controller battery monitor. In single battery mode a short press of [ENTER] on Taranis cycles between all the sources. Min value is also tracked for the 2 sources and can be shown with a [MENU] short press on Taranis.

Note:If you use a second FLVSS voltage sensor the OpenTX variable has to be renamed to "Cel2"

When a second battery is detected the script also tracks "aggregate" battery values and shows a "B1+B2" label in the right panel. Cell value and battery voltage is the "minimum" between the two batteries, current is summed and capacity percent is averaged. A short press of [MENU] on Taranis or [ENCODER] on the Horus will show min/max values for this aggregate view.

In dual battery mode a short press of [ENTER] on the Taranis switches from single aggregate view to individual dual battery view. Subsequent short presses of [ENTER] in this dual view will cycle between voltage sources. In dual view a short press of [MENU] on Taranis shows individual packs min/max values.

To get back to aggregate view and retain the selected voltage source short press [EXIT] on Taranis.

For detailed info on supported battery configuration please check the [wiki](https://github.com/yaapu/FrskyTelemetryScript/wiki/Supported-battery-configurations)

**Note:On the Horus voltage source has to be selected from the menu and Min/Max values are accessible by switching to the dedicated screen**

## Airspeed vs Groundspeed

The frsky passthrough telemetry library can send on the radio link only 1 speed value.
Where it picks that speed value depends on arduplane configuration.

- ARSPD_TYPE > 0 : an airspeed sensor has been enabled in arduplane.
The telemetry library will try to use airspeed even if the sensor is unhealthy, if itâ€™s unhealty the reported speed will be 0, with a healthy airspeed sensor the reported speed will be actual airspeed.

- ARSPD_TYPE = 0 : no airspeed sensor defined in arduplane. The telemetry library will always send groundspeed (gps)

To recap: the script has no control and simply displays what arduplane is sending based on airspeed sensor configuration.

## Alerts

There are 2 battery level alerts, both are set as cell voltage so independent from cell count. Battery level 1 should be set higher than battery level 2.

When cell voltage falls below level 1 it will trigger a vocal alert and the V next to the cell voltage will start blinking: once triggered blinking will persist even if the voltage raises above level 1.

When cell voltage falls below battery level 2 it will trigger a second vocal alert and the cell voltage digits will start blinking: once triggered blinking will persist even if the voltage raises above level 2.

If the battery reaches the failsafe level (it must be configured in mission planner) the script will display "batt failsafe" on the hud and play a vocal alert every n seconds (period can be configured from the menu).

It's also possible to configure a timer that will trigger a vocal alert every n minutes of flight time.

The script also support a "vocal fence" feature by setting a minimun altitude, a maximum altitude and a maximum distance alert.
When the vehicle moves outside of the fence the script will play a vocal alert every n seconds.

**Note: (applies to versions 1.7.1 and above) The battery monitoring engine has been modified to allow the voltage to drop below level for up to 4 seconds before triggering the alert. During this period the voltage background will flash to indicate that the alarm is about to fire, if during this "grace" period the voltage raises above level the alarm is reset.**

## Telemetry reset

It's possible to do a full script reset by resetting timer 3.

For the reset to occur 2 conditions must be met
- flight time is greater than 00:00
- vehicle is not armed

## Configuration

![X10 menu](https://github.com/yaapu/FrskyTelemetryScript/raw/master/HORUS/IMAGES/x10menu.png)

![X9D menu](https://github.com/yaapu/FrskyTelemetryScript/raw/master/TARANIS/IMAGES/x9dmenupag1.png)

![X7 menu](https://github.com/yaapu/FrskyTelemetryScript/raw/master/TARANIS/IMAGES/x7menupag1.png)

Complete menu options list:
- voice language: english, italian, french and german
- battery alert level 1, default is 3.75V
- battery alert level 2, default is 3.5V
- capacity override for battery 1
- capacity override for battery 2
- disable all sounds
- disable msg beep: disable sound on incoming message
- disable msg blink: disable text blink on incoming message
- default voltage source: disable autodetection and force either FLVSS,A2 or ArduPilot as battery voltage source
- timer alert every: play a vocal timer alert and speak flight time at configured intervals
- min altitude alert: minimum altitude vocal fence
- max altitude alert: maximum altitude vocal fence
- max distance alert: maximum distance vocal fence
- repeat alerts every: alert period in seconds
- cell count override: disable cell count detection and override it manually
- rangefinder max: enable rangefinder and enter maximum rangefinder distance
- enable synthetic vspeed: ignore telemetry vertical speed and calculate it from atitude variations
- ground/airspeed unit: select either m/s, km/h, mph, kn
- vertical speed unit: select either m/s, ft/s, ft/min

The language of the vocal alerts is independent from the radio language and can be configured from the menu.
Right now only english, italian and french are supported but new languages can be added with ease.

Battery capacity for battery 1 and battery 2 is automatically read from the values configured in mission planner but can both be overidden from the menu. When a new capacity is defined from the menu it will immediately be used in all calculations and it's value will be displayed on screen.

## ArduPilot Configuration

The two main wiring configurations are

#### ArduPilot sends native frsky passthrough telemetry data

The flight controller is configured to send native frsky passthrough telemetry data either with an inverting cable or without (pixracer). To enable this feature the SERIALn_PROTOCOL of the uart connected to the receiver has to be set to 10, check the ardupilot wiki for [details](http://ardupilot.org/copter/docs/common-frsky-telemetry.html#frsky-telemetry-configuration-in-mission-planner).

This configuration requires a "special" cable that acts as logic level converter and inverter, an example of such a cable is [here](https://discuss.ardupilot.org/t/some-soldering-required/27613)

For the pixracer an inverting cable is not needed but the wiring requires that the TX and RX pin of the frs port be connected together, check this [image](https://docs.px4.io/assets/flight_controller/pixracer/grau_b_pixracer_frskys.port_connection.jpg) for further details.

#### ArduPilot sends mavlink telemetry data

The flight controller is configured to send mavlink messages and an external board (Teensy, Blue Pill,etc) is used to convert mavlink to frsky using Eric Stockenstrom [MavlinkToPassthru](https://github.com/zs6buj/MavlinkToPassthru) firmware. 

This is the default configuration for long range systems (Dragonlink, TBS Crossfire, ULRS to name a few) unable to carry native frsky telemetry but compatible with mavlink.

## Installation on Taranis

Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/yaapu/FrskyTelemetryScript/wiki/Installation-on-Taranis-radios) for more info

## Installation on Horus

Please check the [wiki](https://github.com/yaapu/FrskyTelemetryScript/wiki/Installation-on-Horus-radios) for more info

## Compilation

To compile your own version you must first preprocess the SOURCES/yaapu0.lua scripts with the pproc.lua preprocessor.
Details on the preprocessor can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/incinirate/d52e03f453df94a65e1335d9c36d114e)

You need a working lua interpreter for this to work.
On a command line simply run "lua pproc.lua yaapu0.lua yaapu9.lua"
The yaapu9.lua script is now ready to be compiled in Companion.
